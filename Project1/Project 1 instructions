# Techdegree Project 1: Personal Profile Page

## Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below:

Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size:
keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB (see the link in the resources section to Picresize,
an online image resizing tool)


  - Using a text editor, modify the HTML of the index.html file:
- Add the images you collected in step 1 to the page.
- Personalize the text on the page by changing the name, background and goals. Feel free to make up the information
if you do not wish to share anything personal.
- Adding links to your GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If you don't have a Twitter or LinkedIn account,
 or don't want to share those, then delete those links.
- Feel free to expand on this project, by adding an additional page or two, adding more images and customizing the CSS.
- If you do not want to add an additional page then delete the experience link in the HTML.
